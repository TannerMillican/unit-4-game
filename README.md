What Crystals Collector Does:

Crystals collector is an app that generates a random value between 19 and 120 and assigns it to the score that the player tries to match.
It also assigns a random, hidden value between 1 and 12 to each of four crystals.
The player then can click each crystal to find out the value of each crystal. (This adds to the player's current score that is trying to be matched to the randomly generated value between 19 and 120).
Once the player has either matched or gone over the target number, the app displays an alert of either "You win!" (if the player matches their score to the target number) or "You lose!" (if the player exceeds the target number). 
At the same time this alert is shown, the game resets with new, randomly generated numbers and the player can try again.
